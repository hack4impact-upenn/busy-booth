@interface BFPaperButton : UIButton <UIGestureRecognizerDelegate>

/* Notes on RAISED vs FLAT and SMART COLOR vs NON SMART COLOR:
 *
 * RAISED
 *  Has a shadow, so a clear background will look silly.
 *  It has only a tap-circle color. No background-fade.
 *
 * FLAT
 *  Has no shadow, therefore clear backgrounds look fine.
 *  If the background is clear, it also has a background-fade
 *  color to help visualize the button and its frame.
 *
 * SMART COLOR
 *  Will use the titleLabel's font color to pick
 *  a tap circle color and, if the background is clear, will
 *  also pick a lighter background fade color.
 *
 * NON SMART COLOR
 *  Will use a translucent gray tap-circle
 *  and, if the background is clear, a lighter translucent
 *  graybackground-fade color.
